### What has been done

- Have written a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
- Have written a new test "The menu".
- Have written a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
- Have written a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
- Have written a test "Initial Entries".
- Have written a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
- Have written a test "New Feed Selection".
- Have written a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
